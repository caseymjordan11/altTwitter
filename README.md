# README

Description: 

This app is basically a mini version of Twitter. It works bsically just as twitter does, minus the retweet functionality.
A user can make a profile, follow and unfollow other users and tweet as they wish, as well as like and reply to other users tweets. 

Features: 

The features are as expected if you are familiar with Twitter. As described above a user can have a username and a profile picture, tweet as much
as they want, see what others tweet when they follow them, unfollow other users and so on. Every tweet keeps track of the number of favorites and replies
and every user account keeps track of the number of tweets, followers and users they follow. Tweets can also only be 140 characters long. 

Technologies: Ruby on rails and CSS were the only technologies used. HTML erbs were added for content display purposes. 

Contributing guidelines: users can fork and change this repo as they wish.
